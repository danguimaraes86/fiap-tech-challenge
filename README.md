# User Validantion API 


This is my first developed REST API, created as an active study method for applying my recent Spring Boot concepts learned.

The project contains functions for create, read, update and delete users, in addition of a stateless acess control with JWT Tokens.
The application also has a role validation, roles as ADMIN can use all functions, but default users are more limited.
